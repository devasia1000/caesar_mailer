Usage #1: java -jar <nameofprogramfile>.jar <email_address> <password> <directory_of_textfiles> <directory_to_place_files_after_processing>

Usage #2: java -jar <nameofprogramfile>.jar regextest <regexExpression>

A few things to remember:

2) Both the list of adresses and subject MUST be only one line in the text file, the message can take up multiple lines
3) You can name each of the text files whatever you want, it doesn't matter!
4) Make sure there are no spaces in the path to <directory_of_textfiles>
5) Don't shut down your computer right after writing the text files, wait for the emails to be sent (approx 2 mins)
6) You will need to install Java
7) Enjoy the program!
